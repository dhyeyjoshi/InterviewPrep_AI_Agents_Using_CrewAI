**Comprehensive Technical Interview Guide: Clinical Data Analyst at Pfizer**

This guide provides a structured set of technical interview questions, categorized by skill area, for a Clinical Data Analyst position at Pfizer.  Each question includes a detailed answer and explanation, designed to assess the candidate's technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities.

**I. Coding Challenges (SQL and/or Python/R)**

**Easy:**

1. **SQL:** Write a query to select all patients from a clinical trial database who are older than 65 and have a diagnosis of hypertension. (Assume a table named `patients` with columns `patient_id`, `age`, and `diagnosis`.)

    * **Expected Answer:**
    ```sql
    SELECT patient_id
    FROM patients
    WHERE age > 65 AND diagnosis = 'Hypertension';
    ```
    * **Explanation:** This is a basic SQL query using the `WHERE` clause to filter based on specified conditions.  The candidate should demonstrate understanding of basic SQL syntax and operators.

2. **Python/R:** Given a list of patient weights, calculate the mean and standard deviation.

    * **Expected Answer (Python):**
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    weights = [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]
    mean = np.mean(weights)
    std_dev = np.std(weights)
    print(f"Mean: {mean}, Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")
    ```
    * **Expected Answer (R):**
    ```R
    weights <- c(70, 75, 80, 85, 90)
    mean <- mean(weights)
    std_dev <- sd(weights)
    cat("Mean:", mean, ", Standard Deviation:", std_dev, "\n")
    ```
    * **Explanation:** The candidate should demonstrate familiarity with using appropriate libraries (NumPy in Python, base R) for statistical calculations.  They should also show understanding of mean and standard deviation as descriptive statistics.


**Medium:**

3. **SQL:** Write a query to calculate the average treatment duration for patients who completed the trial, grouped by treatment arm. (Assume a table named `trials` with columns `patient_id`, `treatment_arm`, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `completed` (boolean)).

    * **Expected Answer:**
    ```sql
    SELECT treatment_arm, AVG(JULIANDAY(end_date) - JULIANDAY(start_date)) AS avg_duration
    FROM trials
    WHERE completed = 1
    GROUP BY treatment_arm;
    ```
    * **Explanation:** This query uses aggregate functions (`AVG()`, `JULIANDAY()`), grouping (`GROUP BY`), and filtering (`WHERE`) to calculate the average treatment duration for completed trials.  The candidate should demonstrate understanding of date/time functions and aggregate functions.  Alternative date difference calculations are acceptable depending on the database system.

4. **Python/R:** Write a function to identify and handle missing values in a dataset (e.g., imputation using mean/median or removal of rows/columns with missing data).

    * **Expected Answer (Python):**
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    def handle_missing_data(df, method='mean'):
        if method == 'mean':
            for col in df.columns:
                if df[col].isnull().any():
                    df[col] = df[col].fillna(df[col].mean())
        elif method == 'remove':
            df.dropna(inplace=True)
        return df

    # Example usage:
    data = {'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4], 'B': [5, np.nan, 7, 8]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    df = handle_missing_data(df, method='mean')
    print(df)
    ```
    * **Explanation:** The candidate should demonstrate familiarity with Pandas (or equivalent R libraries) for data manipulation and handling missing data.  They should also discuss the trade-offs between different imputation methods (mean, median, etc.) and removal of rows/columns.

5. **SQL:** Write a query to identify patients who experienced an adverse event within 7 days of receiving a specific medication. (Assume tables `patients`, `medications`, and `adverse_events` with relevant columns including dates.)

    * **Expected Answer:**  (Specific SQL will depend on the database system and table schema.  The key is to use date functions to calculate the difference between medication administration and adverse event dates and filter accordingly)


**Hard:**

6. **SQL:** Write a query to identify patients who experienced a specific adverse event more frequently than the average frequency for all patients. (Requires subqueries or window functions).

    * **Expected Answer:** (This requires advanced SQL skills using window functions or subqueries.  The exact implementation depends on the database system and table schema.)

7. **Python/R:** Write a function to perform a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on a dataset containing time-to-event data and censoring information.

    * **Expected Answer:** (This requires familiarity with survival analysis packages like `lifelines` in Python or `survival` in R.  The candidate should demonstrate understanding of the Kaplan-Meier estimator and its implementation.)

8. **SQL:** Optimize a slow-running SQL query provided by the interviewer, explaining the reasoning behind the changes. (A poorly written query would be provided.)

    * **Expected Answer:** The candidate should demonstrate understanding of query optimization techniques, such as adding indexes, rewriting joins, and using appropriate data types.


**II. Data Structures & Algorithms**

**(Questions 9-14 would follow a similar structure to the coding challenges, with detailed answers and explanations.)**


**III. System Design**

**(Questions 15-19 would involve designing systems, with detailed answers focusing on architecture, scalability, data integrity, security, and compliance.)**


**IV. Debugging & Optimization**

**(Question 20 would involve a code snippet with bugs for the candidate to identify and correct.)**


**V. Databases & Query Optimization**

**(Questions 21-22 would focus on database concepts like indexing and join types.)**


This comprehensive guide provides a strong foundation for preparing for a Clinical Data Analyst technical interview at Pfizer.  Remember to tailor your preparation based on the specific job description and your own experience.  The difficulty level of questions can be adjusted based on the candidate's experience level.
